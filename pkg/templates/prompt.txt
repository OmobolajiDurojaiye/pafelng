I'm working on the user side of my logigstic app, I want to make the quotes_update template to list out all the quote submitted by the logged in user
the listed quotes will all be linked to a page where a detailed overview of each quoted are and the user will also be able to perform other actions just like it is in the admin_vehicle_verification_details and global_courier_details template
so make the quotes_update template list out all the quotes submitted by the signed in user (of course, the service type will be specified in the quote, there could be a dropdown filter for the services too)
onclick of any quote, it should link to the page where a detailed overview of the quote submitted is, including the messages the admin has sent regarding the quote and users would also be able to respons to these messages too


this is our color:
:root {
  --primary-color:rgb(193, 211, 218);
  --primary-light: rgba(66, 176, 213, 0.1);
  --accent-color: #ff7f50; /* Coral - complements blue nicely */
  --dark-color: #333;
  --light-color: #f8f9fa;
  --text-color: #333;
  --white: #fff;
  --gray: #6c757d;
  --light-gray: #e9ecef;
  --border-radius: 12px;
  --transition: all 0.3s ease;
  --box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}


design a modern, sleek, beautiful, attractive, futuristic design, logistic-like page

The HTML, CSS AND JS files should be in different files

NOTE THAT THE JAVASCRIPT SHOULDN'T RENDER AANYTHING ON THE TEMPLATE, JUST FOR DESIGNS FORM FUNCTIONS (LIKE REGULAR FUNCTIONS FOR THINGS LIKE DESIGNS and FORM VALIDATION) AND STUFF, WE'RE NOT USING AJAX EITHER

!!remember this is a flask app, don't use jinja yet cause this is just the frontend, but don't also do something complicated that when the backend is here it will desctroy it, be mindful!!

I TRUST YOU ON This
THANKS
