I'm working on the admin side of my logigstic web app I want to create the signup page for admins to signup, but we have a special way to signup, here is it:
To secure the admin signup, we'd do this â€”when a new staff is signing up, a number code will be sent to the email of the owner, so the new staff will inputs the number, if correct, he officially becomes an admin, if not, then a security breach is occurring and that way, not just anyone will be able to signup as an admin on the app.

in my instance folder, i have these codes:

SECRET_KEY = "bcnneubpwbcyaue7443bvcs643kbbcwex3272fwede"
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="mysql+mysqlconnector://root@127.0.0.1/pafelng"

MAIL_SERVER="smtp.gmail.com"
MAIL_PORT="465"
MAIL_USE_TLS=False
MAIL_USE_SSL=True
MAIL_USERNAME="durojaiyeomobolaji93@gmail.com"
MAIL_PASSWORD = "qmdj yttn mwkw qnmj"

for the owner email and the MAIL_PASSWORD

so create the functionality for sending a six number code

so when the new admin signs up using his name, email, password, he'd then be redirected to a new page for him to input the code sent to the owner's email, and if correct, he then gets signed up as an admin of the app

and then he's redirected to the login page to login (we'd work on login later, just do the signup first)



this is our color:
:root {
  --primary-color:rgb(193, 211, 218);
  --primary-light: rgba(66, 176, 213, 0.1);
  --accent-color: #ff7f50; /* Coral - complements blue nicely */
  --dark-color: #333;
  --light-color: #f8f9fa;
  --text-color: #333;
  --white: #fff;
  --gray: #6c757d;
  --light-gray: #e9ecef;
  --border-radius: 12px;
  --transition: all 0.3s ease;
  --box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}


design a modern, sleek, beautiful, attractive, futuristic design, logistic-like page

The HTML, CSS AND JS files should be in different files

NOTE THAT THE JAVASCRIPT SHOULDN'T RENDER AANYTHING ON THE TEMPLATE, JUST FOR DESIGNS FORM FUNCTIONS (LIKE REGULAR FUNCTIONS FOR THINGS LIKE DESIGNS and FORM VALIDATION) AND STUFF, WE'RE NOT USING AJAX EITHER

!!remember this is a flask app, don't use jinja yet cause this is just the frontend, but don't also do something complicated that when the backend is here it will desctroy it, be mindful!!

I TRUST YOU ON This
THANKS
