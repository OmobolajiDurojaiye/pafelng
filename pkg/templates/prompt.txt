‚ö†Ô∏è Common Reasons for Vehicle Seizure in Nigeria
Here are the top reasons why vehicles get impounded by Nigeria Customs:

1. Incorrect Vehicle Documentation
Many car owners unknowingly import vehicles using fake or incomplete documents, especially those bought through unofficial dealers.

2. Underpayment of Customs Duty
Some importers under-declare the value of their vehicles to pay less duty. This is easily flagged during verification checks by NCS.

3. Vehicle Smuggling
Smuggling through unapproved entry points or without proper customs clearance remains a big issue.
