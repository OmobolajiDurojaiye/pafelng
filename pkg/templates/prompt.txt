I'm working on one of the services of my logistic web apps, so this particular service is the Global Courier, i need to create a form in it with these inputs:

Name:
Email: 
Phone Number:
Courier Company: provide options: DHL, Fedex, UPS, Aramex
Tracking Number:

Add a back button with history.back() so users can go back to the previous page


this is our color:
:root {
  --primary-color: #42b0d5;
  --primary-light: rgba(66, 176, 213, 0.1);
  --accent-color: #ff7f50; /* Coral - complements blue nicely */
  --dark-color: #333;
  --light-color: #f8f9fa;
  --text-color: #333;
  --white: #fff;
  --gray: #6c757d;
  --light-gray: #e9ecef;
  --border-radius: 12px;
  --transition: all 0.3s ease;
  --box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

this template will serve as a base template for the other services pages

design a modern, sleek, beautiful, attractive, futuristic design, logistic-like form page

The HTML, CSS AND JS files should be in different files

NOTE THAT THE JAVASCRIPT SHOULDN'T RENDER AANYTHING ON THE TEMPLATE, JUST FOR DESIGNS FORM FUNCTIONS (LIKE REGULAR FUNCTIONS FOR THINGS LIKE IF A USER DOESN'T INPUT  FORM IT SHOULD NOT SEND) AND STUFF, WE'RE NOT USING AJAX EITHER

!!remember this is a flask app, don't use jinja yet cause this is just the frontend, but don't also do something complicated that when the backend is here it will desctroy it, be mindful!!

I TRUST YOU ON This
THANKS
